I am a graduate student in the Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence integrated M.S. & Ph.D. program at [POSTECH](https://www.postech.ac.kr). I am a member of the [Computer Vision Lab](http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/lab/) at POSTECH, working with Prof. [Suha Kwak](https://suhakwak.github.io). \
\
My research interests lie in computer vision and deep learning. I've worked on the Foggy Scene Segmentation, Robust Recognition in Adverse Conditions, Domain Adaptation, and Generalization.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
